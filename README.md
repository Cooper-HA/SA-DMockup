The goal of this software will not be to replace the use of Tabroom. Instead, it will serve as proof-of-concept alternative software that could be implemented on a lower level. 
Tabroom is a worldwide software aiming to encompass all tournament needs. This software would only be employed on a local level and cater to the Helena School District Speech and Debate teamâ€™s needs. 

This software will read and write tournament information, store and catalogue student, coach, and organizer information, and allow users to look at and sign up for tournaments.  

The front end will be a simple web application that can run in a browser that functions like a website with pages. Forms will be used to fill out participant data and for organizing tournaments. 
Users will be able to see past and upcoming tournaments, as well as the participants.  

 

Scope: 

- The scope of this project is as follows: 

- NOT a public or commercial piece of software

- NOT to have a feature complete UI/UX 

- Barebones proof-of-concept
